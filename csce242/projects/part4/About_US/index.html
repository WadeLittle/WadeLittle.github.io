        <div id="why">
            <h2>Why we started</h2>
            <p>We started this business with the same drive that fuels most entrepreneurs: a passion for the product and
                the potential for success. At just 16, we believed that with determination, we could make a big impact.
                Back then, consignment stores were charging around 10% fees and offering prices at or below market
                value. However, over time, many of these stores became greedy, hiking their fees to 15-18% and
                significantly inflating prices. Frustrated by this greed and the negative effect it had on the sneaker
                community, we decided to create a platform that prioritizes fair pricing, authentic sneakers, and
                exceptional customer service.

                <h2>Saahil Yerkola</h2>
                <p>Saahil Yerkola, a finance student at the University of North Carolina, has been deeply immersed in
                    the sneaker community for years. With strong connections to local Raleigh store owners, Saahil has
                    successfully tapped into a wide customer base through multiple consignment stores, as well as
                    partnerships with bulk sellers, allowing him to efficiently move large volumes of products. Despite
                    the fluctuations in the sneaker market, Saahil has consistently found ways to stay profitable and
                    grow his business. Now, he's taking his expertise and extensive inventory online, aiming to build a
                    one-stop shop for sneaker enthusiasts

                <h2>Wade Little</h2>
                <p>Wade Little is a Computer Information Systems (CIS) student at the University of South Carolina,
                    where he combines his passion for coding with a love for fashion and entrepreneurship. His
                    entrepreneurial journey began in high school during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he started reselling
                    shoes. What began with a single pair quickly grew into a thriving business with over 50 pairs in
                    inventory by the time he entered college.

                    Though Wade liquidated his inventory upon starting his freshman year, he maintained strong
                    connections within the sneaker community. He has since channeled his skills in web development to
                    support his friend Saahil in launching an online platform, making Saahil's inventory accessible to a
                    broader audience.
