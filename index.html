<p>
The Affinity Diagram is split into 5 clusters. Random, Startup Thoughts, Product Ideas, Partnerships, and Questions.
 The random section has ideas that don't fit into any other category. The startup thoughts are the main ideas and 
 thoughts about how to get the company started and growing. Product ideas contain lots of different solutions for the problem,
 but most of the solutions involve technology. The partnership cluster is ideas about different partners and connections that 
 could be beneficial to the growth of the company. The last cluster is just different questions that we need to try 
 and find answers in order to create our product.
